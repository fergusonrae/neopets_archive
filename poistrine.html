<h1>» Being Polite</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1117.gif">
Let's face it, people can be annoying. Don't gasp like that, because you know it's true. And with those millions of users out there, there is no possible way that you can be best pals with all of them and be well liked by everyone. But, it is possible to be polite to everyone, no matter how hard. There are just some simple things that you have to keep in mind<br><br><b>You're <i>REAL</i>?</b><br>
The first is that these are real people you are talking to, not usernames. And people generally have feelings. So, if you wouldn't say it to a person's face, don't say it on Neopets. I think they teach you this when you go into kindergarten.<br><br><b>Don't you honey me!</b><br>
The next is stop with the honey, darling, etc. If you must say something to someone don't say these words that make the person you are talking to feel three years old. It's extremely annoying especially if you would like an answer to a question and all you're hearing is "Honey, what are you doing here," because that's not telling people what you want to tell them. So, instead of saying that and people not knowing what you mean, say "I'm sorry, this is the wrong board for that. Try the ____ board.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1982.gif"><b>Revenge Rating</b><br>Lets say that you wanted something to be rated on the boards. Well, some 'mean' person comes by and they say that your rating is a 0/100 and worthless. Then they ask you to rate something of theirs. You should totally give them a -100/100!<br><br>
This is called revenge rating and is terribly rude. The rating you got was just that one person's opinion and they were actually trying to help you out by saying that it wasn't good and that your needed to fix it. They were trying. However, if you just go back and say that their page was worthless, you aren't trying and that could cause them to feel that something is horribly wrong with their page when there isn't. So, you are the mean person.<br><br><b>Look at me! I'm Miley Cyrus!</b><br>Agghhhh! These boards make me want to tear my hair out. They're not funny, they are simply annoying, and the worst thing is that people keep bumping up these boards by arguing with the creator of the thread.<br><br>So, please do not pretend to be someone you're not on Neopets. Everyone knows that the real Miley Cyrus' username wouldn't be imileycyrus12343. So, try your hardest not to create these annoying boards and if you see one, don't bump it up by arguing with them. Just ignore it.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1776.gif"><b>Reporting</b><br>This is a touchy subject because everyone thinks different things based on reporting someone. Here are the steps most people agree you should do though when you need to report someone<ol><li>Tell the person that what they are doing is against TNT's rules. They might not know, and usually after you tell them, they will stop doing whatever it is they are doing. No need to report! However, if they don't stop...</li><li>You can report. Do this with caution though, Neopets doesn't like people being reported who really didn't do anything wrong. So, please use your head and don't be report happy.</li></ol><b>Lyk OmG</b><br>
This is a major pet peeve of most of the people in the HC. Now, if this is how you chat to your friends while neomailing or chatting on your guild board, that's perfectly fine. However, it's frowned upon on the Neopets Boards, and unacceptable on the Help Chat. It all comes down to respect. Would you talk to your grandparents like that? Because who knows, you might be talking to them. 0_o How's that for a thought?<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1952.gif"><b>You spelled that incorrectly</b><br>
Correcting someone's grammar is one of those maybe circumstances. So, when someone is asking you a question and you notice that they spelled one or two things wrong in their post, just let it slide! No need to embarrass them, especially if it's a long word, or obviously a typo. But, if you feel that you need to correct their mistake or burst, there is a polite way of doing it.<br><br>First of all, don't just fix their grammar and leave. Not polite. If you're going to fix their grammar, at least take a shot at answering the question. Also, try to do it nicely don't just say "Embarrass isn't spelled Embarass you n00b!" That is a horrible thing to say. Instead go with "Hi, I noticed you spelled Embarrass wrong, the dictionary spelling is Embarrass. I understand though, because it took me forever to learn that word!<br><br>That leaves the person feeling like they're not the only one, even if you could spell it in your sleep since you were five. People could answer to your post about their spelling in two ways. 1. They could thank you for correcting them 2. They could get defensive. Which one they become depends mostly on what you said to them.<br><br><b>Trolling</b><br>This is something that is kind of creepy. What trolling is, is when you randomly say mean things on a board or follow a user from board to board, usually saying rude things. Really, people? I mean, come on. This is very childish. If you don't like a Neopets user that much, block them. You do this by going to My Account, Neomail, Block. Then you type in the person's username. Boom. You no longer have contact with each other and as long as you don't end up on each others boards, you'll never hear from them again.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1607.gif"><b>n00b-be-gone</b><br>A n00b. Not to be mixed up with a newbie, is a player that is annoying, immature, or otherwise unlikeable. N00bs do things like scamming, spamming, and trolling, and are looked down upon in Neopian society. If someone calls you a n00b, you were probably harassing someone or, they are at fault and think newbies to be n00bs. So, just try not to be a n00b, and don't call everyone you see a n00b.<br><br><b>Please and Thank you</b><br>How many times have you heard the word please on the Neoboards? I think I've seen it 4 times, 6 tops. But, it's one of the simplest forms of manners. In kindergarten you learn what the "magic word" is, so now that you're older, use it! Just because your mother isn't looking over your shoulder is no need to lose your sense of rightness.<br><br><b>Spamming</b><br>Spamming is when you either go to, or make a board and say things that are irrelevant to what is being discussed, or, you are stating things that do not belong on that board. For instance, asking the BD if anyone can lend you MSPP could be considered spamming if you continue to ask, when they have already told you that you are on the wrong board. Also, constantly saying random things that have nothing to do with what is currently going on could also be considered spamming.<br><br>Now, while spamming is annoying, just try to ignore the spammer. Try not to report, because TNT are very busy people, and aren't that interested in one little spammer. Just don't bump up the board by arguing with the person and hopefully they'll just go away. Unless of course the spammer is saying rude or inappropriate things.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/2081.gif"><b>Woo</b><br>That's a lot of stuff to remember when on the NeoBoards, right? But really, just remembering common manners and being on guard is all it is. If though, you have met someone who seems to be lost in the NeoBoards, you may refer them to this page so they can learn all the stuff that comes with having a Neopets account.<br><br>So, good-bye! *weeps* If you like this tutorial though, check out our others too!</div>

<h1>» What are Fonts/Siggys?</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1110.gif"><b>Familiar Territory</b><br>Ah, fonts and siggys. Something that I love to do in my free time and know all about. And now it's time to teach you, young one. But first, it would probably be best to show and tell you what fonts and siggys are, and what the difference is between the two.<br><br><b>What are they?</b><br>A font is the way your lettering looks when you type it on Neopets' boards. A siggy is a signature that can be above your text, below your text, or both. Because I know this is kind of hard to grasp when reading it, I'll show you three examples of posts on the Neoboards.<br><br><br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/Fontex-1.jpg"></center><br><b>Font</b><br>This is an example of font and only font. You can see that they made their words bold, but there is no words or pictures surrounding the text. So, whenever she types, only the text that she types shows up. That means that the person has no siggy.<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/siggyex.jpg"></center><br><b>Siggy</b><br>
This is an example of a siggy or signature. The person who made this post will have the music notes and phrase "Chomby Love" every time they post, but their text will change. As you can see though, they did not use font because their text remains unchanged. It is the normal, default Neopets font.<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/siggyandfontex.jpg"></center><br><b>Font and Siggy</b><br>
This last post had both a siggy and a font. You can see the siggy was the purple, pink, and blue. Her text was small and centered, so that was her font. So, she has them both!<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/956.gif"><b>Don't know what I'm talking about?</b><br>If I still didn't explain it right to you, hop on down to the HC boards and they will be happy to tell you what fonts and siggys are in a way that makes sense to you. However, if you do understand what they are, let's continue.<br><br><b>Getting One</b><br>So now that you know what siggys and fonts are, you probably want to get one so that when you post on the message boards, you look all hip and groovy. Well, there are two possibilities. 1. Get a pre-made 2. Make one yourself. <br><br>Pre-mades are very simple to get and generally look really cool. There is no shame in having a pre-made siggy and font like there is in having a pre-made guild layout. They are suggested for people who don't know how to make fonts and for people who don't have the time.<br><br>Making a font/siggy yourself is often difficult though and not suggested for those with little time on their hands. If you wish to learn how to make fonts however and you know some HTML, try to learn by taking other people's pre-made fonts apart and seeing what does what. That's how I learned almost everything I know about how to make fonts. Also, you can use alt codes in your siggy. Alt codes are little pictures that are created when holding down the alt key and then pressing a number. These pictures include hearts, faces, and arrows. For a listing of some popular alt codes, check out our section alt codes (coming soon!).<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1795.gif"><b>Putting it on</b><br>To place a siggy/font on your posts, (Assuming you are using a pre-made. If you aren't, then you will have to fill in all your coding yourself) go to Boards, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/preferences.phtml" class="you">Preferences</a>. A page will come up. The first box on this page is where you can change your avatar. To learn more about avatars, visit out <a href="#avatar" class="you">avatars</a> page. The next box is where you can change your NeoTitle. This is something you can just choose. It is displayed on your posts below to your avatar. Then there is a box that says NeoHTML/Signature. You paste the first box of coding that you copied into the first long rectangle here. Then you go back to the pre-made site and copy the second box of coding. Come here and paste this coding into the second box rectangle. After that, you scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and click submit.</div>

So you're chatting on a board to someone and all the sudden they say something, but you're not sure what it stands for. So, if you're like me and you don't want people to know that you don't know what that is, just make sure you have a window or tab with are abbreviations page open, and you'll be an internet chat speak king or queen in no time!<br><br>

<h1>» Avatars</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/927.gif">So what are avatars anyways? It's a question many people new to Neopets wonder. And, wonder of wonders, here's the answer right here on this page!<br><br> An avatar is a little picture that, when you post on the boards or in your guild shows up next to your name. If you have never changed your avatar, it is yellow with some lighter yellow stars on it. This is one of the default avatars and everyone has it. There are many other default avatars that everyone has (61 to be exact) that you can change to.<br><br>To change your avatar, go to boards, preferences, and then to the first box which says "avatar." There should be a picture of your current avatar, a drop down menu, and a picture of the avatar you're previewing. Once you choose an avatar, scroll to the bottom of the page and click submit. Then, go and show off your avatar in the boards!<br><br> There are also many, many secret avatars that not everyone has. These can be achieved by random events, doing something, or clicking on something. These are the things most people<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1296.gif">collect just so they can show them off. Also, it looks cool when people look at your lookup and see how many avatars you have. A lot and you look really experienced. So, the following are ways to get <i><b>some</b></i> of the secret avatars. Obviously I can't post all of them because they're secret!<br><br>It's separated into two categories, clickable and working. With the clickables you just click on their picture and it will take you to another part of the site and you'll get the avatar. Then you can just push your back button and click on another one.<br><br>With the working ones you actually have to roll up your sleves and do a little work for. Next to the avatar it describes how to get it. So, get to work getting all those fresh, new avatars to show off. (:<h1>Clickables</h1>

So, this tutorial was created to help you find the best guild for you from someone who has <b>lots</b> of guild experience.<br><br><b>Different Kinds</b><br>There are many different kinds of guilds, but the main one's are: Neopets Related, Role Playing, Anime, Multitheme, Random, Celeb, Artistic, Battledome, and Avatar. As I said, these are the main types, but there are many other types of guilds you can explore. Now lets go into the most common of the most common.<br><br><b>Neopets Related</b><br>As it is called, this type of guild is related to Neopets. This is probably the most popular of the types of guilds merely because there are Neopets images all over the site that they can use in there layouts. This type of guild often has contests and Neopets related layouts.<br><br><b>Role Playing</b><br>
Role Playing Guilds center around role playing, which is when you act like someone or something else. To get the hang of this, I suggest that you go to the Role Playing board and ask around. People there will be happy to tell you all about it.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1791.gif"><b>Multitheme</b><br>This kind of guild doesn't have a set theme. It can be anime one day, and Neopets Related the next.<br><br><b>Avatar</b><br>This kind of guild is all about avatars, how to get them, and showing them off. Often these types of guilds require you to have a certain amount of avatars to join. To read more about avatars, visit out <a href="#avatar" class="you">avatar</a> page.<br><br><b>Private?</b><br>Why do some guilds not let you join unless you fill out an application? That's because those guilds are private. The guilds are only seen by their members and those invited to join. <br><br>
People make private guilds because of several reasons. 1. They don't want illiterate or people who don't fit their requirements to join or 2. They don't want anymore members.<br><br>If a private guild <b>is</b> looking for members an you wish to join, most likely you will have to fill out an application. This is a list of questions about you that you will then Neomail to a member of the guild. Some private guilds are very easy to get into, some are very difficult. Just remember not to feel sad or angry if a private guild rejects you. There are always more guilds.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1942.gif"><b>Searching</b><br>Once you have an idea of what kind of guild you want, it's time to start searching for it. Don't bother going to the guild hompage and searching there though unless you know the name of the guild you want to join. If you just decide to type in Neo Related because that's the kind of guild you want, you will be given a list of guilds that 99.99/100 will all be completely inactive. That means no one goes there or the leader was frozen.<br><br>Your best bet for looking for a guild is to go to the guild boards and make a new thread by saying as your title<br><br> ;) I am guildless and I'm looking for a _______ guild :*<br><br>The smiley faces will catch people's attention and by filling in the blank with the kind of guild you want, people who have the same kind of guild will automatically go towards you.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/760.gif"><b>Reading the posts</b><br>
When looking at the posts of the people who read your thread and wanted to reply, it's important to remember a couple things. One is if in their post they say "pretty please join my guild! You can do whatever you want, just join!" is a sign that they are way too desperate. They don't want your company, they just want a member.<br><br>The Second is when they try to bribe you to join their guild by offering you items as prizes for joining. This includes Newbie Packs. These are against TNT's rules and if the guild keeps it up, it will be deleted very soon. No sense in getting attached to it.<br><br>The third is when offered an invitation to a private guild or an application to fill out, try it! Don't just skip over these guilds because you're too lazy to write down a few things about yourself. Usually private guilds are a very good guild to be a part of because they have a good amount of members and are pretty well established.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1984.gif"><b>Too...</b><br>Another thing to remember is that sometimes there are too many members in a guild and sometimes to little. If your joining a guild so you can chat to people, you won't want to join a guild with only 3 members. Chances are, there won't be members in the boards when you want to chat with someone and it would be boring hanging out there all day just waiting for people to show up.<br><br>On the other hand, guilds with 70+ members often start to feel very impersonal. While there would probably be someone to talk to every time you go into the guild, you wouldn't personally know anyone and it can often seem like no one's even listening to your posts.<br><br>If all else fails, try leaving your guild status to chance. Go to a random persons userlookup and see what guild (if any) they're in. Sometimes they will be in a private guild, so you won't be able to see the actual guild, but that's okay. Just go to a different person's lookup and try again. I have found several great guilds by doing this, and when you join your Neo Friend's guild, you can have tons of fun. (: Never hesitate to Neomail the owner of the guild though. Often they will be happy to answer your questions.<br><br><b>More Guilds</b><br>

<h1>» Creating Your Own</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/2024.gif">You've been dreaming about it for months, or maybe you just decided today to throw it together. Either way, there is a special knack for creating a guild that is popular and fun.<br><br>So, unless you're going to create a guild that is just for all of your neofriends, you're going to need to find a way to get and keep members in your guild, and that is no simple task. Today's members want it all in a guild. They want a guild that is perfectly suited to their needs, and a leader that is active and fun to be around, not just someone they neomail with complaints. So, with all that in mind, we step into the actual tutorial. :D<br><br><b>Do you want a guild?</b><br>A question some people should really think about. After all, owning a guild is not for everyone. It can be a very stressful job trying to suit all of those members and keep people in your guild. Not to mention trying to get more members in your guild while not making it "crowded." So, here's a little checklist you should do before deciding if you should be the leader of a guild.<br><br><ul><li>Are you on daily?</li><li>Do you have lots of extra time you can spend on the guild board chatting to members?</li><li>To you respond to neomails quickly?</li><li>Are you able to deal with annoying people with patience?</li><li>Are you an experienced neopian?</li><li>Do you understand that guilds are meant to be kept, not deleted in a week?</li></ul>If you answered no to any of the above, you are probably not meant to own a guild. That's okay though! I, for one, will never be a guild owner. I find Neopets much more fun when I'm not having to deal with all you people! (You know I'm just kidding.)<br><br>Being a member in a guild can be a lot of fun if you get in the right guild though. So, if you know you aren't going to be able to own a guild, but wish to be a member, check out our <a href="#goodg" class="you">Finding a Good Guild</a> page and if you already know what your looking for in a guild, visit out <a href="#greatg" class="you">Great Guilds</a> page. It's a listing of guilds I found interesting and their ratings.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1845.gif"><b>But I Wanna!</b><br>So you <i>still</i> want to be the owner of a guild even though I told you all the bad stuff? Well, I guess there's no stopping you know, you should very determined.<br><br>At this point in time you have basically two choices for your guild. A. Go to alone B. Have a co-owner or two or ten. Here are the good qualities of both.<br><br><b>Going it Alone</b><br>There are some perks to being the main leader in a guild. You have all the power and people come running to you when they have a problem. And that's okay in moderation.<br><br>If you want a small guild with only a few members, it would probably be fine if you didn't have any other owners. Guilds with 15 and under members are pretty stress less and you can just spend the day chit chatting with your members on the boards. However, if you're planning a guild with 20+ members, then just you probably won't be enough. You'll need...<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/259.gif"><b>Other Ownies</b><br>There are many perks to you not being the only owner and leader of the guild, especially if you have lots of members.Having more than one owner will take a lot of the pressure off you so you can have more fun time with your members. Also, not everyone will be coming to you with all of their complaints which, believe me, can get very frustrating after a while when your patience starts to wear thin.<br><br>More ownies also means more ideas for your guild. They can give you ideas that mean the world to your members and make your guild very popular.<br><br>On the other hand, the guild will no longer be all about you. You won't have all the power and this might be frustrating when another owner tries to take control over the guild and you can't stop them.<br><br><b>Finding Your Co-Owners</b><br>
If you decided to go alone, just skip over this part. :) To find other people to co-own your guild, simply go to the message boards, guilds, and create a thread that says<br><br>{{ YOUR NAME HERE }} is MAKING! /care to help?/ :*<br><br>This will really catch people's attention. Also, something you must know is that you have to keep bumping these boards. People take a while to get there. Once people <i>do</i> get there however, you should have them fill out an application that looks something like this.<br><br>Name:<br>Experience in Guilds:<br>HTML/css:<br>Examples:<br>Other:<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1418.gif">Having them fill out their name gives you something to call them. Having them tell you their experiences in guilds makes sure that you are finding another person that is able to be an owner. HTML/css is whether they can code layouts or blogs, etc. It is very useful when you yourself do not know how to code and need someone who can create layouts. Examples is the proof that they can actually code layouts, and make them too. And other is just any other useful information they think you should know. <br><br><b>Creating</b><br>Now it's time to create! What you do is going to Shops, Guild Home, Create New. Make sure that you aren't already in a guild before you create, or else Neopets will not let you past clicking that little Create button.<br><br>Now on to actually filling out the info for your guild and deciding what is important, and what isn't. I will now go through the information Neopets commands you to fill out and what you're supposed to do with it.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1285.gif"><i>Choose a Neighborhood</i>: Pick whatever you want. It honestly doesn't matter a tiny bit.<br><br><i>Desired Guild Name</i>: Does matter. This will be the name of your guild and preferably it should be something short and what your guild's about.<br><br><i>Guild Welcome Message</i>: Type a couple random letters in this box. You will change this later on.<br><br><i>Will this guild be a private guild?</i>: A private guild means only you and the people you choose to send an invite to can see it. Preferably (especially if you have other co-owners) you choose no. You can always change your
guild to private later on if you really wish.<br><br><i>Present Color Schemes/ Background, Header, etc.</i>: You can change these later. They have no meaning right now. Choose a couple of random colors or, if you really want to, you can choose colors.<br><br><i>Guild Council 1, 2, etc</i>: Leave it for now, you'll change it later.<br><br><br><b>Done!</b><br>Your guild is now created!

<h1>» Your Guild Layout</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/764.gif"><b>Your Layout</b><br>According to a random selection of people on the HC board, people most appreciate it when you have great, active members, and tons of stuff to do in your guild. I admit that these things are nice. But, how would you know those things unless you join the guild. And, the best way to get people to join your guild is to have a smashing layout.<br><br>A messy layout seems to tell potential members that your guild is, well, messy. And a neat, crisp, interesting layout, says the same about your actual guild. That's the reason that there are so many premade layouts out there. People are afraid to have their layout be all messy. However, this is one of the worst things you can do to your guild.<br><br><b>Premade Layouts</b><br>Do you want a guild for all of your friends? Then, premades are fine for you, and great if you're on a time scrunch. However, if you are you trying to get people you don't know to join, you should never use a popular premade layout.<br><br>Premades seem to say "I don't have the time to make a layout," which translates to potential members, "I don't have time for a guild." This is especially so if you are taking a premade from a site that is very popular with Neopians like SunnyNeo. The layouts in these sites are all over Neopian, and it gets sickening seeing them over and over on everyone's guild. You should want your guild to stand out as original, not the same as everyone elses.<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/656.gif">Taking a layout from a lesser known site though, may work out for you. If people don't know the site, they don't know if you made it or not unless they actually go to the site on your lookup. This helps when your trying to get members, especially on the Guild boards where presentation is everything.<br><br>
But, there's always an exception to the rules. I have seen a couple guilds, with the same layouts as everyone else, having 100+ members. A lot of this comes down to luck, but you may get lucky. So, if you really want to chance it, take a premade. But, if you want an interesting layout that people don't just look at, and then move on, you should try making your own (using our Paint tutorial!) or requesting one.<br><br><b>Requesting</b><br>
There are two ways to request a layout. The first is on the Help boards, the second is by sending an application to a site.<br><br>When requesting a layout on the Help boards, be sure not to seem like you're begging. Also, DO NOT offer a reward or prize in exchange for someone making you a guild layout. This can be, and is, reported and it's sad how many people I see doing it. But, if you have no luck at the boards, you can always try...<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/2031.gif">Requesting from a site is different from the boards because you know that an experienced person will be doing your layout, if they say that they will. Also, you know that your layout will be one of a kind, and may even be personalized with your guild name or motto.<br><br>
To request a guild layout from a site, you must first find a site that will do requests. Often, sites have an open/close sign that tells whether they are taking requests. Then, you will have to fill out a form that will ask what kind and style of guild layout you would like. Then, you just neomail or post the application and wait. Hopefully, you will get your layout, but sometimes you don't because you must realize, most people have things to do. Except me, which is why I'm here. Also, if you're having difficulty finding a site that does requests, there is a list at the bottom of this page :D<br><br><b>Making your own</b><br>This is a daring decision for some. Some people can whip up a layout, no problem, but some can't. Generally, this area takes lots of practice, especially if you're planning on doing a complicated layout. But, if you're really set on it, see our Guild Layout link under Paint and follow the instructions.<br><br>Also, you have to remember to always include navigation on your layout if your layout covers up the navigation Neopets has. This is very important because if you don't, people won't be able to leave your guild D:<br><br>And, if your layout covers up the sidebar with all of your guild links, you have to put those links on your page, because if you don't, people won't be able to get into your message boards or even join!<br><br><b>Linkage</b><br>And now here's the links to sites offering requests that gave me their permission to put them up here.<br><br></div>

<div class="section"><a name="adguild" id="adguild"></a>
<h1>» Advertising Your Guild</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1649.gif"><b>Are YOU ready?</b><br>
This is a personal question that you shouldn't have to ask because advertising your guild is pretty simple. What you do is go to the NeoBoards, Guild Board, and respond to posts made by other people saying that they are guildless with your guild link/webbie and a little bit about your guild.<br><br><b>Please Don't</b><br>Make your own thread that is. No one visits it when you make your own thread and no one joins. It's a waste of your time. You should be spending that time answering other people's posts. Besides, all the guildless people will be on their own threads looking at the guilds that posted, not scanning through the list of topics.<br><br><b>What do I post?</b><br>
This is a great question because what you post has a lot to do of whether or not someone joins your guild. First, let's look at some examples of answering a guildless thread.<br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/guildad-2.png"><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/919.gif"><b>So</b><br>What's the difference between these two posts? Well, first of all, the most important thing to leave the guildless person with is a link. If you don't that means the guildless person (let's call him Al for the sake of not saying guildless person over and over) will have to search to find a link and if it's a lazy person, they won't bother looking at all. I for one would skip right over this post.<br><br>*Important* If you are in a private guild do NOT post the link to your guild. It will not work. Instead post a link to your guild's webbie and if your private guild doesn't have a webbie, you should get one (;<br><br><b>Capitalization</b><br>This is also very important. Netiquette states that capitalization shall be reserved for when you are yelling at someone and I do not like people yelling at me to join their guild. In real life I would walk quickly by you trying not to make eye contact, and you have to act like this is real life. Be polite and direct while still being a little fun and calm.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1728.gif"><b>Chatspeak</b><br>Gah, this has to be the worst against all crimes when making a guild advertisement. You have to remember that you are representing your guild and you shouldn't make it look sloppy and messy.<br><br>So, spell out the words and if you didn't pass 3rd grade English, get a spell checker installed on your computer. It will get you lots more members.<br><br><b>Begging</b><br>
Repeat, begging is bad, bad, BAD! If you are offering people items or saying join more than twice in the same sentence, stop!<br><br><b>What's it About?</b><br>
You should also include what, generally, your guild is about. Such as my example, where I said that my guild was about carrots. Just don't say that your guild is themeless because for me, personally, it's annoying. Your guild is MULTI THEME, not themeless.<br><br><b>Extra Tidbits</b><br>
Try to make sure that you state your name in your guild advertisement. It makes it seem more personal and inviting. Also, end your post with a "neomail me if you need anything!" This also makes the ad very inviting. Finally, put down something that's happening in your guild to show that your guild is active and fun. This could be anything from "we're waiting on the boards to met you" to "We're looking for council." Just to show that something's happening.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1901.gif"><b>Beware of the happy</b><br>One thing I didn't include in the bad post was a smiley face. Well, one or two smiley faces are okay, but if your doing a smile or a star or something like that every other word, it looks horrible. Please beware!<br><br><b>Copy and Paste</b><br>
Many guilds these days have copy and paste guild ads so all the guild members use the same, nice, informative post. I think that this idea is a good one if you can write a good ad. If you can't this is a terrible idea because all of your posts will be the same horrible message. D:<br><br><b>Reading</b><br>
Aside from the posting you do, the most important thing to do when you reach a thread of a guildless person is to read their first post. It will usually have instructions as to what kind of guild they want and, often, a secret word that they incorporate into their post that you<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/924.gif"> have to state back. For example, somewhere in their first post they might have written "Say hula if you read this" and unless you post the word hula with your guild ad, they will not consider you because you didn't read their post.<br><br><b>Go!</b><br>You should now be ready to post a guild ad with ease all the while catching people's attention. Bravo, and make sure to add For You to your bookmarked pages to make sure you remember all the information I've just thrown at you. :D</div>

I've included it because I know how difficult it is to find a guild on the boards since it's a thing left to chance. So, the guilds are organized by category with their name, rating, special info, and link to either the guild or the webbie, if it is private.<br><br><b>Ratings</b><br>
This is how the rating breaks down...<br><br>

Do you think that you're guild should be on this page? Well, first of all, you should be an owner. I don't just want members to submit their guild without one of the owner's consent. If you are an owner, then submit your guild link (if private, invite me) along with some simple guild info like what theme it is and it's name. I will then become a part of your guild for a while to check all the things that are to be rated. If you receive a score of 85 points or higher, you will be included on this page. If you do not score 85 or above, I will neomail you your score along with some suggestions. If you read this, include the word Kougra as your subject in the neomail. That is all.

Generally, pretty good with posting, and there are very few that are just spam. But, there are times when everyone is posting up a storm, and other times when there is nothing there for 20 minutes at a time. But, this is to be expected with time zones.<br><br><b>L</b> : 11/20<br>
Layouts are simple. There's not much to them and they're using images that are on everyone else's guilds. The cropping technique used to place images in the layouts looks rather odd, since some of the background is left still in tack. Also, the images on the Neo Sig page and the background on the Pharmacy are non existent.<br><br><b>T</b> : 19/20<br>
There is no shortage of things to do in the guild. My personal favorite was the quilt page. Very unique. But, the avatar lending page only has lending for avatars that people can get very easily by themselves. Also, when you are lent and object for collat, you're supposed to get all of your collat back, not just a part of it.<br><br><b>O</b> : 9/10<br>
Since you are an NR guild, you can't really get full points here. But, your activities are extensive and original, and so if your friendly atmosphere. <br><br><b>E</b> : 10/10<br>
This guild seems like it has been around a long time. It has so much to see, do, and talk about.<br><br><b>A</b> : 10/10<br>
The leader of the guild is very integrated into every part of the guild. She post regularly on the message board, hosts the trades, auctions, guild webbie, and donation shop, and he makes most of the layouts.

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1991.gif"><b>Confused!</b><br>Microsoft Paint is one of the simplest programs for image editing there is. In order to use it, you still have to know what the tools are though. So, I made a screenie and neatly labeled each tool with a number. Below the screenie is the numbers, what tool it is, and what it does. That should make it pretty easy to start experimenting with this awesome program.<br><br>By the way, order to open Paint on your computer, go to Start, All Programs, Accessories, Paint. There you are (:<br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/untitled-4.jpg"></center><br>1. Free-Form Select: This tool is used when you want to select a specific area. However, it should not be used for precise selecting, because it can be very difficult to control.<br><br>2. Select: This tool lets you select an area using a square. You can only select areas using this rectangle, but it is very easy to use and you can make selections precise.<br><br>3. Eraser/Color Eraser: This tool erases. Really though, it just colors everything white, which will erase your color, but it will not erase white.<br><br>
4. Fill With Color: This tool will fill the area of the same color you click on with the color you are currently using.<br><br>5.

Brush: Just like pencil, but you get to choose the width and shape of your line.<br><br>9. Airbrush: Creates a bunch of dots like you are spray painting something. Is great for creating lots of tiny dots like stars.<br><br>10. Text: Lets you write text on your selection.<br><br>11. Line: Lets you draw a straight line with your selected width.<br><br>12. Curve: This tool allows you to draw a straight line, and then make it so it curves.<br><br>13. Rectangle: This tool allows you to draw a rectangle and lets you choose how you want to fill it in.<br><br>14. Polygon: Lets you easily make geometric shapes. Rarely used.<br><br>15. Ellipse: Lets you draw a circle or an oval.<br><br>16. Rounded Rectangle: This tool will let you create a rectangle with rounded edges. Good for when making text boxes on your selections.<br><br>
17. Draw Opaque-On: Whenever you select something with a white background, that white background stays when placing your selection over another.<br><br>18. Draw Opaque-Off: Whenever you select something with a white background, the white disappears when you place that selection over another selection.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1814.gif"><b>Huh?</b><br>
If you don't get one of the tools I explained, open up your computer's MS Paint and try it out. Often, playing around with the tools makes things much more clear then me trying to tell you about them.<br><br><b>Something Extra</b><br>I just thought I'd leave you with a little something that lots of people don't know about MS Paint. It's that when drawing with the pencil or line you can hold shift and your tool will create a straight, vertical line no matter how much you move it!</div>

<h1>» MS Paint Guild Layout</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1135.gif">I'm sad to report that it's rather hard to find a site that shows you exactly <i>how</i> to make a full page guild layout. But, <i>For You</i> is one of those select few I suppose. So, the materials you will need for this...<ul><li>Microsoft Paint Program</li><li>A photobucket account</li><li>A Neopian guild to put your layout on</li><li><i>For You's</i> tutorial on Coding a Guild Layout</li></ul>So, let's get started!<br><br>
First, open your program of Paint. Then right click on the image below and click save image as. Then, save your image as whatever you want. Now, go back into paint and click open, and choose the file you saved that image as. It should now be on your canvas.<br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/untitled.jpg" width="570"><br><br><b>Decorating!</b><br>Now it's time to decorate your image that you should have opened. (This is the fun part!) Go to Paint and check out your tools. If you don't know what any of the tools are, go to our Paint Tools tutorial. So, use your tools and go crazy with color, line, and crazy shapes. The three things to remember though, is 1. Do not color in the boxes yet 2. Do not use anything other than solid color or lines 5 pixels from the bottom of the image and 3. Do not add text or images yet. We'll do that later (:<br><br>So, here's how mine turned out<br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/templetafter-1.png" width="570"><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/2041.gif"><b>Oooo</b><br>Mine turned out pretty and simple, which is how I like my guild layouts. But now it's time to add some stuff that will really give it a punch. (By the way, if you want to see any of my images full scale, right click them and then click properties. Copy the URL and paste it into a new tab or window and hit enter.)<br><br><b>Adding images</b><br>
Now's the time to add images to your guild layout, since it would be pretty boring without them. You can use any pictures you would like on your guild layouts, but obviously no pictures of yourself (or people you know) or pictures copyrighted to another company or person. For this tutorial, I will be using Neopets shopkeepers since those pictures are easy to find and place in my layout.
<br><br>So, I go to the Neopian Shopkeepers in my shop, and save one or more of their pictures to my computer. For this tutorial, I decided to use gelert shopkeepers since my guild will be all about gelerts. Now, before you put in the pictures click on the rectangle select button, and then click on the opaque off button. Shown below.<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/clickopaqueoff.png"><br><br></center>Then, while you are still on the rectangle select, right click on the canvas and then click paste from. Click on one of the pictures you want to put on your layout. Place it wherever you want except in the boxes or 5 pixels from the bottom. Repeat for the rest of your pictures. Also, you might have to color in the white parts of your picture like the eyes. So here's mine after adding the pictures of gelerts.<br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/templetafterpic-1.png" width="570"><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1793.gif"><b>Text</b><br>Now's the time to add text to your guild layout. First thing that you should put is the guild name. Mine is .:Gelerts are Awesome:., so I put that on there in a font called Cheri Liney. I had to download it, but isn't it awesome?<br><br>Then add any other text you want to. . Also, make sure you add your username to the layout to show that you made it! (It also cuts down on layout stealing.) So, here's my finished heading of my layout.<br><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/templetaftertext-1.png" width="570"><br><br><b>The rest of the layout</b><br>
This part it a little tricky. But first, save the heading you just created. Now, click onto the rectangle select and go to just a tiny bit before the end of your heading and select the ending, all the way across. Before you do this though, make sure that you are on the 0px to the left mark, so you know you're getting the entire bottom of the heading. Then, copy this part and open a new program of Paint.<br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/templetselect.png" width="570"><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1752.gif"><b>Bottom</b><br>In the new program of Paint, go up to Image, Attributes. Change the width and height to 1px. Then click okay. Now, paste the bottom of the heading that you copied. Save it.<br><br>Ta da! You are now ready to code. :) Just click on our Coding a Guild Layout link under Coding Tutorials and get ready to have that sparkly new layout up.</div>

<h1>» Gimp Tools</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1859.gif"><b>The tools</b><br>Now, these tools are from Gimp 2. Here's the tools with a number on them and looking below, the numbers match the descriptions. Also, everything after <i>Foreground Select</i> on the image varies depending on what tool you are currently using.<br><br>
Also, these are not all the tools, they are just the ones that you will probably use most often. So, for any tools I have not listed here, try another tutorial or, better yet, experiment with your program of Gimp.<br><br><br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/Tools.png"><br><br></center>1. <b>Rectangle Select</b>: Lets you select parts of what your working on in a rectangle or square shape.<br><br>2. <b>Fuzzy Select</b>: With this tool you can select large regions of the same, or about the same, color. You do this by changing the threshold. A threshold of 0 and it will select only the exact color. A threshold of 255 and it will select every possible color.<br><br>3. <b>Color Picker</b>: Just like the eyedropper on Paint. Lets you "pick up" the color of whatever you clicked on.<br><br>4. <b>Zoom</b>: Lets you zoom in on your canvas to see better. Click your mouse repeatedly to zoom in closer or farther away.<br><br>5. <b>Move</b>: After you have selected something on your canvas, you can move it around by clicking on the move button and dragging the selection.<br><br>6. <b>Text</b>: Lets you insert text into your canvas. Works just like Paint. Also, if you wish to change text you already clicked out of, click on the text icon, then click on the text you want to change. You must click on the actual text though, not just inside the box. Once you merge layers, this is not possible.<br><br>7. <b>Bucket Fill</b>: Just like in Paint. Fills an area of the same color. Can fill with either solid color or pattern.<br><br>8. <b>Blend</b>: Usually called the Gradient Tool because it creates gradients, which are colors blending into other colors, across your canvas. There are many gradients to choose from.<br><br>9. <b>Pencil</b>: Creates a jittery line that you draw in the size of your choice.<br><br>10. <b>Paintbrush</b>: Just like pencil, except that it creates a smoother line when you are drawing.<br><br>11. <b>Eraser</b>: Erases stuff.<br><br>12. <b>Smudge</b>: Pretend that you had orange paint and blue paint right next to each other and you ran your finger across the line where they meet. You would mix the colors right? Well, this is what the smudge tool does on your canvas.<br><br>13. <b>Color Select</b>: While I do not believe it officially has a name, this is very useful. Click on the color on the top, and you will be able to choose your main color that you use. Click on the one behind the main, and you get to choose your background color.<br><br></div></table></div>

<h1>» Creating a Gimp Blog</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1321.gif"><b>Bloggin</b><br>
Blogs are all useful. You use them to give what you're writing a little oomph so it's more interesting. They are most often seen in Neopian shops and Guilds, but that doesn't mean that you can't put them everywhere else!<br><br>So, instead of getting a boring, generic premade, make your own! Here's how to make an awesome one using Gimp.<br><br>First, take a picture from Neopet's backgrounds and crop it until it is 400px by 300px in Paint. Save, and then go to Edit, Select All. Then go to Edit, Copy. Now, open your program of Gimp and go to File, Acquire, Paste as New. Your picture for your blog should now be there, in Gimp. Yay!<br><br>Now, Go to Layer, Duplicate Layer. You should now have two layers. If you can't see the layer dock however, you should go to Dialogs, Layers and it will pop right up. Click on your top layer and look at the layer dock. There should be the word mode, and then a drop down menu next to it. You can try all the different options there. Each one will change the way your image looks. Make sure that in the end, what you choose isn't too hard on the eyes. My favorites are Multiple, Screen, and Overlay. You can also keep it as Normal if you wish. Here's how my blog looked after I chose Overlay.<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/blogstart.png"></center><br><br><b>The blog area</b><br>First, flatten your image by going to Image, Flatten Image. That will make it so that the layers all blend together so you don't have to keep track of them all.<br><br>Now we're going to make the part that you write your text in. First, add a layer by pushing the little icon that looks like a piece of white paper with it's corner folded down. Once you push that, a screen will come up. Push okay. You should have two layers. Now, while you are selected on the top layer, take your rectangle select and choose the area that you want your blog to be. Like this...<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/BlogSelect.png"></center><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1258.gif"><b>Filling it in</b><br>Now we're going to fill in the blog area. First, make sure that you are on the top, transparent layer. You should already be, but make sure. Now, go to your Bucket Fill tool and choose the color you want your blog to be. I want mine to be plain, old white. So, I choose for my color to be white and then, before I fill in the selected are, move the opacity to 65. Now, click on the selected area and it should fill in so that you can still see some of what's behind the blog. That's good. Push select, none.<br><br>Now, you can choose if you want to add a border around your blog area. I'm going to just for the sake of showing you how. First, change the opacity to 100% on your Bucket Fill. Now, go up to filters, Render, Gfig.... Another screen will pop up. Match yours to mine.<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/Bloggfig.png" width="570"></center><br><br><b>Outlining</b><br>So, you will want to push on the rectangle looking thing and then you will want to choose a form of brush and a different color. Preferably, for the brush, you choose a small circle.<br><br>Now to outline. Once you have the brush and color you want, go to the top left corner of your blog that we just filled in. Click, and then drag until you outline the entire blog, and then let go. You should now be able to see it on the preview and on your actual image. If the brush doesn't look right, or you're not on the lines, just push Edit, Undo on the Gfig and it will disappear and you can try again.<br><br> now, this is how my whole blog looks like....<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/blogalmostdone.png"></center><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/626.gif"><b>Lettering</b><br>Now's the time to add some words to your blog. They can have significant meaning or they could go along with the theme. Either way though, they should look cool. So, these words are going to be outlined.<br><br>First, decide what you are going to say on your blog. I'm going to say "Shh, I'm hatching!" So, Now that I have my picture up, I'm going to go to my text icon and decide on a size, font, and color. (You should have a font large enough for people to see, so it should be 18+.) I decided to make my font Cheri Liney, which is a font I downloaded, and am very happy with. So, click on the image, type what you want, and then click off and use the Move tool to put it where you want it. Make sure when moving though, that you click on the actual letters.<br><br>
So, once you move your text to where you want it, click to add another layer to your image, and while you're still on this new layer, click the down arrow on the layer dock to put it below your text. Now, go back to your text layer. Click Layer, Transparency, Alpha to Selection. Your text should be outlined with dashed, moving lines. Now, go to the layer below the text layer that we added just a minute ago. The words should still have that dashed line around them.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1733.gif">Now, go to Select Grow. Grow your selection by a number 1-5, but you can go higher. I'm using 1. Now, take your Bucket Fill tool and choose what color you want the outline to be. Next, take your bucket and fill in the selection of the moving lines. Good! Now go to Select, None. Your text should be nicely out lined.<br><br>Time to add credit to you! Since you made this blog, the credit goes all to you. So, take out your text tool, choose a font, size and color, and try to put your username in a corner of the blog, so it doesn't get in the way of what you're supposed to be seeing.<br><br>
To save it, go to Image, Flatten Image. Then save it as a PNG and upload it to a site like Photobucket. Now that you're done, go to our <a href="#codingblog" class="you">Coding a Blog</a> tutorial to show you how you can get this blog up and running. Also, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and here's my finished blog!<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/blogdone-1.png"></center><br><br></div>

<h1>» Gimp Glitter</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1114.gif"><b>Gimp</b><br>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to make any image you would like, a glitter. All you will need a program of Gimp open and ready to use and a picture. I will be using a Neopets image because they are easy to find and you know they will be appropriate. So, here's my before and after of my image.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><center>Before<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/t_980.gif"><br><br>After<br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/glitter.gif"><br><br></center><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/220.gif"><b>How to do it</b><br>So, how do you make these lovely, glittery images? Well, first, copy an image by right clicking and then clicking copy. Next, go to your program of Gimp and go to File, Acquire, Paste as New. Now your image should be in Gimp. (You shouldn't use transparent images for this, so if you're going to use a Neopets Shopkeeper like I did, you have to unclick the Transparent button.)<br><br>Click onto the fuzzy select and put your threshold at 15. Now, click on every part of the image that you want glittery. Try to make it so that it's only dark colors though, because light colors look funny when you glitter them using this method. After you are finished selecting all the parts you want to glitter, go to Layer, Duplicate Layer and then do Layer, Duplicate Layer again.<br><br>If you have your layer dock open, you will see that you now have three layers. If you don't have the layer dock open, you will need it open so go to Dialogs, Layers. Now, click onto the layer that is on the very bottom of your layer dock. It will probably be called Pasted Layer if you did it the way I have. Now, go to Filters, Noise, HSV noise. Another window should pop up. Match the setting I have.<br><br><center>
<img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/gimpscreenie.png"></center><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/570.gif"><b>The Rest</b><br>8, 0, 0, 255. Match them. Then, click okay and go to the middle layer. Go to Filter, Noise, HSV noise and match the settings again. But this time, put 254 as your value. Push okay and go to the top layer. Do the same thing, but put your value as 253 instead and push okay.<br><br>Your image should have little dots where you wanted it to glitter. To see your glitter, go to Filter, Animation, Playback and push play. You can edit how fast you want it to glitter, but usually, people keep it as 100%.<br><br>Now for saving, the tricky part. Go to file, save as, and select where you want to save it as and then click the little plus sign and choose to save as GIF.<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/gimpsave.png" width="570"></center><br><br>Now, another screen will pop up. Just match my settings again.<br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/gimpsave2.png"></center><br><br>And then another screen. Match again.<br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/gimpsave3.png"></center><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/996.gif"><b>Done</b><br>Alright, your glitter should be saved now and ready to upload. I hope you enjoy it. But, if you decide to make your own glitters for people, it would be appreciated if you linked back. It's not necessary though.<br><br>Hope you liked the tutorial.

<h1>» Coding a Blog</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1887.gif"><b>Coding your blog</b><br>
Do you have a blog, but you don't yet know how to code it? Maybe you created one with me in Making a Blog using Gimp? Either way, it's time to code it so that you can put it on the internet.<br><br>First, make sure that you have the blog uploaded already. Have the unloading site on one window and on the other go to either edit your pet page, shop, userlookup, etc. Now, while keeping these two windows open, go to your program of Paint and open the blog that you are trying to code. Now, take your rectangle tool and trace the blog box (the part where your text will go). Now don't let go! Hold down the mouse and when you've outlined that box, look in the lower right hand corner. There should be two sets of numbers. Write these numbers down without letting go of the mouse. See my example....<br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/blogmeasure.png" width="570"><br><br>Do you see how I labeled my numbers? Well, that's what those numbers stand for in the coding below. Now you have to do the same thing again, but this time, measure the whole blog. Everything. The first set of numbers should be 0, 0 so write down only the second set of numbers that you get from measuring it. These will be the blog width and height.<br><br>So, here's all of the coding. If you are a coder extraordinaire, I guess you can change it. But, it if a fragile code, and if your new to HTML and css, don't mess with it too much if you still want it to work D: Fill in all the capital letters with your info, but do NOT erase the px after the capital letters.

<h1>» Basic HTML</h1>
<b>Mad Guitar</b><br>
ARE YOU READY TO CODE??!! Sorry, felt like having a rock moment. But really, if you feel up to it, I have created a condensed guide to HTML. However, it is no substitute for the actual guide found on Neopets which would be <a href="//www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml" class="you">Neopets' HTML Tutorial</a>. This is just a little guide you can turn to if you really don't get what it is they're saying in the Neopets one, which I doubt because it's an awesome tutorial. (:<br><br><b>In the beginning...</b><br>All HTML and CSS starts with brackets. Brackets are what tell the computer that it's coding. Here are what brackets look like.  So all of your coding goes inside those little things.<br><br><b>Common Codes</b><br>
The most common code you will use in your coding would be a break. A break is writtten like this<br><br><center><textarea><br></textarea></center><br>Putting one of those on your page between words will<br>put in a break, so it would be like you had pressed enter at that spot. (Did you see the above example?) You can put many breaks next to one another, but as many breaks as you have, that as many times as you would press enter to move down the text.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/929.gif">Next is <b>bold</b>. When you write this code it makes the text you put around it <b>bold</b>. Now, this code has a beginning and an end. The beginning is the part where it tells the computer "Hey, I want this text to be bold!" and you put it right before the text that you want to be bold.<br><br><textarea><b></b></textarea><br><br>
The ending is the part that tells the computer "Okay, that's enough bold. I want you to stop making my text bold." You put the ending after all the text that you wanted bold.<br><textarea></textarea><br><br>Now there is underlining too. See the bold part for what it is, but the two codings are here.<br><br><textarea></textarea><br><br>There is also <i>italics</i><br><br><textarea><i>
</i></textarea><br><br>And <strike>strike out</strike><br><br><textarea><strike>
</strike></textarea><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/960.gif"><b>Font</b><br>Changing your font using HTML can seem tricky at first, but really it's just like underlining or making your text bold. When you want to change the color, size, or face of your font, you use a font tag.<br><br><textarea><font></font></textarea><br><br>But just putting that won't be enough to change your text, you have to tell the computer what it is that you want to change about the text. So, lets say that I want to make my text bigger.<br><br>I would write...<br><br><textarea><font size="3">
</font></textarea><br><br>That would change my text to <font size="3">size 3 and it would stay this way until I told it to</font> stop.<br><br>You can go up to size 7 for your text, and that is plenty. You can try out font sizes until you figure out what suits you best.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1227.gif"><b>Color</b><br>Now I want to make my text a certain color. This time, I want to make it red. Now, there are two ways of doing this. If the color you want is very common like, one of the colors of the rainbow, you can write your coding like this...<br><br><textarea><font color="red">
</font></textarea><br><br>That would <font color="red">make my font red, just like I wanted it to. And then I could</font> stop it.<br><br>If you want a color that is not common, like Coral or Olive, you cannot use the above. Instead, you have to find that color's Color Hex. It is 6 numbers/letters that can be used to tell the computer that this is the color I want. You would write it like this...<br><br><textarea><font color="#FF7F50">
</font></textarea><br><br>The Color Hex I wrote in there is for the color coral, so it would make <font color="#FF7F50">my text coral colored.</font> So, now that you know how to use it, how do you figure out the Hex Codes for the colors you want to use? Well, thank goodness Neopians will help you out there. Like <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Triflot" class="you">NeoColors</a>. A great site that gives you all the good color's Hex Codes along with an example of each.<br><br>Make sure you always put the number sign (#) in front of the Hex Code though because if you don't, Firefox users can't see the colors D:<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1424.gif"><b>Combining</b><br>You can also combine your codes. Do you see how to change your text size and to change your text color, both codes start with font? This means that you can combine them to save space. To combine them, it would look like this<br><br><textarea><font size="3" color="red">
</font></textarea><br><br>That would create text that is both <font size="3" color="red">size 3 and red</font>.<br><br><b>Face</b><br>
The final final thing you can change on your text is it's face. That's the style you write it in. To change it, go onto MS Word and find a face you like that is one word long. Then fill it in on the code. I chose the face Crate.<br><br><textarea><font face="crate">
</font></textarea><br><br>So, my text will <font face="crate">look like this</font>. And remember that you can combine this code with the others because it starts with font.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/917.gif"><b>Lists</b><br>
Lists are very handy to organize your information. They come in two varieties, numbered and bullet points. Bullet points are much more common, but both are used. To do bullet points, you would write<br><br><textarea><ul><li> Hello
</li><li> Second point
</li><li> w00t
</li></ul></textarea><br><br>The ul says that you are starting a bullet list and the li's are the bullet points. So, the above would look like this<ul><li>Hello</li><li>Second point</li><li>w00t</li></ul>And then we're back to normal. Now, for number lists you would type<br><br><textarea><ol><li>Hello
</li><li>Second Number</li><li>w00t</li></ol></textarea><br><br>And it would look like this<ol><li>Hello</li><li>Second number</li><li>w00t</li></ol><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1428.gif"><b>Background colors</b><br>
This is for changing the background of your entire page. (Will not work for shops.) I am not going to demonstrate what this one does because I like my layout. So, once you find your color, plug it into<br><br><textarea></textarea><br><br>Make sure to place the /body at the very end of your coding for the entire page. By the way, this code will make your background a purple color.<br><br><b>Putting in Pictures</b><br>Everybody puts in pictures. Now, you're going to learn how to. The coding begins with img src=" ". Between those two apostrophes you are going to put the URL of your image. To get the URL, you either have to upload your picture to a site like photobucket, or if it is already an existing image and you have their permission to use it, like Neopets images, you can right click the image and then click properties. A little box will come up and it will tell you the image's URL. You then place that URL in the spaces and it would look like this<br><br><textarea><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/564.gif"></textarea><br><br>Try this code somewhere to see what it's a picture of!<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/970.gif"><b>Positioning</b><br>
Sometimes you don't want all of your stuff on the left hand side. Sometimes you want your text and pictures centered, or to the right. So, there is a code that does that too! Just put it before the thing(s) that you want to be centered or to the right and then put in the /div when you want everything to go back to the left hand side.<br><br><textarea><div align="center">
or
<div align="right">
</div><br><br><b>Links</b><br>Look to the left, what do you see? Probably a bunch of links to other tutorials I have made. Well, I made those links to those tutorials using this code! So, here's how it breaks down. {a href="URL"}LINK{/a} is the code with the actual brackets. The a  -disallowed_word- tells the computer "Okay, I want this to be a link." Then the URL is the page's URL that you want to make the link go to. The LINK is what you want the link to say. Then, obviously, the /a is to stop the linking. So, The actual coding looks like this<br><br><textarea><a href="/"> LINK </a></textarea><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/766.gif"><b>Tables</b><br>
Tables have to be one of the most difficult things to explain. So, I am sorry if you still don't get it after I do my best to tell you about them.<br><br>Let's start with the beginning of the most basic table code. Here's the code, I'll explain later.<br><br><textarea><table><tr><td> Blah </td><td> blah2 </td></tr></table></textarea><br><br>
The coding always starts with {table} when making a table. This tells the computer that you are making a table.
Next comes the {tr}. This tells the computer that you are starting a row. Do you see how {tr} ends with an r for row? Then comes {td}. This says that you are starting a cell in that row. In this instance, the cell will say Blah, because that's what you put as being in your cell. Then, you end the cell by saying {/td} and begin a new one by saying {td}. In this new cell, you say Blah2. Then you end the cell and end the row and finally end the table. Here's a little diagram (thank to Neopets) that shows what exactly a cell. row, and table is.<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/help/table1.gif"></center><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1183.gif"><b>Size</b><br>
You can also change the size of your table overall, your row, or your cell. If not changed, the table will automatically make its self a certain size to fit all of your words and pictures. However, sometimes you want your table to be bigger or smaller. To change your table, you can put as your coding<br><br><textarea><table width="0" height="0"><br><br>You would fill in the space with the number of pixels you want your table to be high, and how many pixels you want your table to be wide.
<br><br>You can change the size for {tr} and {td} too by adding the height=" px" width=" px" to the tags.<br><br><b>Borders</b><br>If you don't put in this part of the code, your table will not have a border around it. D: So, to add a border around your table put<br><br><textarea><table border="1"><br><br>So, you choose a number 1-4 for the width of your border and I added a little extra thing in the code which would be the border color. When you put a Hex Code in there, it will change the color of your border. If you don't put this, your border will remain black.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/252.gif"><b>Good and Ready</b><br>Okay, now I've taught you all the important things mentioned in the Neopets HTML guide, but if you don't get anything I've said please either neomail me, or check out the actual Neopets guide. The link was in my first paragraph. Also, if you think somethings missing or wrong in this guide, neomail me so I can get it all fixed up. (:<br><br>Anyways, hope you learned something and if you already knew all of this, check out our advanced HTML guide for codes not listed in the Neopets HTML Guide.

<h1>» Advanced HTML</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1854.gif"><b>Know it?</b><br>This tutorial is for people who already know their basic HTML. This tutorial has lots of extra little tidbits to take your page from eh to woah. However, I will not be going through every little step with you, so I hope you can keep up!<br><br><b>Divs</b><br>
A very popular code, this is used for positioning words and images perfectly on a page. The actual code looks like this<br><br><textarea><div style="position: absolute; overflow: auto; top: -blocked-; left: -blocked-; width: -blocked-; height: -blocked-;">
What you want to say goes here!</div></textarea><br><br>Overflow:auto means that you want the text to stay in a certain area and if the text overflows, it will become a scroll box. Top:___px; is where you should fill in how many pixels from the top of the page you want the words/images to be positioned. Left:___px; is the same as top, but it's the number of pixels from the left.<br><br>
Width:___px; is how wide you want the imaginary box that is holding all the text/pictures in and height:___px; is how tall it is. The width includes the scrollbar if you need one.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1978.gif"><b>Text Areas</b><br>A text area is a way to give people codes for something. As you can see below, my text area is grey. To make a text area write<br><br><textarea><textarea>blah blah blah </textarea><br><br>
The blah, blah will be your codes that you want to show up. And remove the space between the / and textarea in the coding.<br><br>But remember, if you want to put in a text area on a pet page, you have to add an underscore between the text and the area.<br><br><b>Other ordered lists</b><br>
There are more ways to list things than just ordered lists and bullet points. Here are some that I have found. The coding is above and the example below.<br><br><textarea><ol><li>Making
</li><li>Lot of
</li><li>Lists 
</li></ol></textarea><ol><li>Making</li><li>Lot of</li><li>Lists </li></ol><br><textarea><ol><li>Making

</li></ul></textarea><ul><li>Making</li><li>Lots of</li><li>Lists</li></ul><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1139.gif"><b>Marquee</b><br>
Marquees are a fun way to get special info caught in people's attention. They are fun to watch and create, so here's how to create your own!<br><br>
Now, just remember. No matter how fun marquees are, it's best to leave them at one a page, two is really stretching it. Since you have to follow marquees with your eyes, you don't want peoples eyes going in all directions!<br><br><textarea>Here's my marquee</textarea><br><br>Here's what that marquee would look like...<br>
Here's my marquee<br><br>It's okay, but it's kind of boring. So, lets change it up and make it interesting. (Obviously you can change colors and subtract things from this code. It's just to show you what's possible! Experimenting is the best way to learn)
<br><br><textarea>  MY MARQUEE!! </textarea><br><br><center><center> MY MARQUEE!! </center></center><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1743.gif" title="Hi rachaeltigercat1!"><b>Hover Charm</b><br>
Do you want your image to say something when your mouse hovers over it like the image over there? « Then use this code! Just replace TEXT HERE with what you want it to say.<br><br><textarea><img src="-blocked-" title="TEXT HERE"></textarea><br><br><b>You're ready</b><br>
Alright, that's all I have for advanced HTML, but if you want to make your page even snazzier, go to our css page. There are many codes their to make HTML even better!<br><br></textarea></div>

<div class="section"><a name="css" id="css"></a>
<h1>» Css</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1228.gif"><b>Humble Beginnings</b><br>Ah, Cascading Style Sheets! But much better known as css, another form of editing your pages on Neopets. Now, this tutorial is for those of you that already know HTML, or at least the basics because I will not be going step by step for you people. <br><br>Also, you should edit and experiment with all of these codes, especially the colors. Experimenting is key to css and HTML! Also remeber that I only put the codes I thought would be usful to you. Now, on to learning!<br><br>All css begins with style tags. All of your css is contained inside these tags and you can add whatever codes from below in and keep out others. Now, when Neopets decides to change their coding, you usually have to change your style tags. This is what they are currently, so <b>leave in the space</b>! If Neopet's changes their coding again, please neomail me and I will change the coding below.

Since I didn't hit on this in the HTML tutorial, I thought that you might want to know what headings are. First, go to the top of this page. Do you see the sign that says » CSS? That, my friends, is a heading. Now look at my navigation. Do you see the signs that say For You's Site, Neopets, etc? Those are headings too. Headings are things to show that you're beginning something new. You can have my different styles of headings too. Do you see the difference between my two?<br><br>Headings can be colorful, no frills, large, small, fancy, simple, whatever you want! There are so many variations that it's hard to show you all the different ways you can make one. So, this is a BIG TIME experimenting code. I will show you three different headings I have made just to show you the extent of heading power.<br><br>Also, you can have many different headings on your page, but you have to call them different names so the computer knows what you are talking about. Your first heading you should name {h1}, your second one {h2} etc. So, when you want to use a heading you can do {h2} This is my heading 2 {/h2} and it will be your second type of heading.<br><br><h5>This is the first heading I've made for you to see!</h5>
