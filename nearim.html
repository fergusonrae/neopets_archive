<h1>» Choosing a Username</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/183.gif" border="0" style="float: left;">You're ready to start Neopets and having fun, but wait. Before you can even have an account, you have to choose a couple things, one of those being your username.<br><br>Your username is the thing everybody who knows you, knows. It's how they contact you, find you, and overall get to know you. So, you wouldn't want to be rushed into choosing a username that is embarrassing or worse, boring. So, here's a little guide on choosing a great username that you will love and enjoy having.<br><br><b>Wrong Number</b><br>Repeat after me, numbers are bad, boring, and show a total lack of interest in your username. Unless they have a significant meaning to you, get rid of them. We don't care how much you love puppies, do not make your username puppy167253. It's hard to remember, and less people will contact you merely because they can't remember your username. Instead use...<br><br><b>Under_scores</b><br>Underscores not only let you be more creative with your username, they will separate words so people can understand it more easily. So, instead of all those numbers, choose something like basket_puppy or puppy_crayon. Very original and much more easy to remember.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1648.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Werd Riting</b><br>Many people will probably fight me on this, but I believe that when you "write creatively" you are giving the message that you are an immature little kid. After all, we have a dictionary so we spell words correctly and, at least to me, there's nothing more annoying than seeing the username luv_kewl_me. This shouts n00b all over it. <br><br>Instead of using these "creative" words, why not actually dig out the dictionary and look for words that no one know, but have cool meanings.<br><br><b>To Review</b><br>So, choose a username that doesn't have numbers (unless significant) and doesn't have weird spellings. You can however use underscores to separate your words and use words that are real, but no one (or almost no one) would know. Doing this, you will be on your way to a fabulous username.<br><br></div>

<h1>» Finding and Naming your Pet</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1150.gif" style="float: right;">You have your username and info all filled out to sign up, but now you're being asked what kind of pet you'd like (if any), what color you want it, what you want it's name to be, etc. There's a lot that you have to fill out on this page, but it's also very simple to understand (thank you TNT!). <br><br><b>Do You Want a Pet?</b><br>A pet needs to be fed, played with, given books to read and toys to play with. Because of this, many players choose that they do not want a pet and instead go on Neopets because of various other things like the boards.<br><br>If you ask me though, Neopets is all about playing with, feeding, and painting <b>your</b> pet. Why, it's why the site was created. Also, having a pet can be lots of fun and you can do so many things with it. My advice, choose to have a pet. It will not die no matter what you do to it and if you decide later that you don't want a pet, you can just disown it at the adoption agency.<br><br><b>Choosing a Species</b><br>You decided to get a pet. Now you are plagued with what seems like hundreds of species you can pick. But which one? This is mostly a matter of choice and only until you start learning about secret avatars and random events are you going to choose a pet not because of how it looks. But for now, just choose a pretty or manly or whatever one you like.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/145.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Limited Edition</b><br>When choosing your species, you no doubt noticed the fact that under Limited Species it said None. That's because some pets you can only get at certain days. These pets include Poogles, Chombys, Cybunnys, Tonus, Jetsams, Kikos, and Hissis. Once you finish setting up your account, you can go and see what these pets look like by going to the rainbow fountain in Neopia Central. <br><br>There are also restricted pets which include draiks, krawks and lutaris. These pets cannot be obtained by going to adopt on certain days, they must be created through other methods such as morphing potions, lab ray, and (in the case of Draiks) being hatched.<br><br><b>Choosing a color</b><br>This is simply a matter of preference. Later, you will be able to choose the color of your pet by painting it with a paintbrush (which cost neopoints). There are many more paint brushes then the four colors you see before you, but more of that later.<br><br><b>Naming Them</b><br>Ah, the difficult naming process. There are really three simple rules to remember with this. 1. Keep it unusual 2. Stay away from numbers 3.Keep it under 10 letters. Remembering those three rules will help you find a name for your pet that is socially respectable. 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/247.gif" style="float: right;">Also, a popular way of choosing a name for your pet is keeping it the same as your username, or tweaking it just a little bit.<br><br><b>The Rest</b><br>
The rest of the info you must fill out is pretty worthless. The most meaningful thing to change is your pet's gender, but honestly the rest of the stuff doesn't matter a bit. Feel free to put whatever you feel there.</div>

<h1>» Faerie Quests</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/489.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Burst!</b><br>
Out of no where a faerie pops up and says get me _____ item. Thinking it's just a cranky faerie you ignore it and keep walking around Neopets. But now you can't use the Shop Wizard because it says that you are on a quest, but you never agreed to be on a quest. What's going on???<br><br>
What happened was when that faerie popped up, you were automatically on her quest, and unless you choose to quit your quest by going to Pet Central, Quests, you will stay on a quest. If you do not want to do the quest, go to the quest page and get out of it.<br><br>However, if you want to do the quest, then I'd better tell you what quests are so you know what you're getting into.
Faeries give you quests randomly throughout the game, and it's your choice whether or not to do them. What the quest asks of you if to get a certain item for that faerie. If you get that certain item for that faerie, you will be rewarded. (: <br><br><b>What's the Reward</b><br>
This is something everyone wonders when they start doing quests, and your reward is different depending on what faerie you did the quest for. The rewards for each faerie will be explained later.<br><br><b>What Kind of Items?</b><br>The items you are asked to get for faerie quests are relatively cheap (1np-10,000nps) with the exception Of the Faerie Queen, Space Faerie, and Fountain Faerie, but their rewards are also greater.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/t_1968.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Sounds Easy!</b><br>Kind of, but you forgot to factor in that you can not use the shop wizard for your item, so you'll have to go through shops, searching and searching and if you finally find the item, it will probably be way over priced. D:<br><br>So TNT created Quest boards! If you are 13 or older you can go into these boards and make a thread saying that you need an item shop wizarded. Then, hopefully someone will answer with a post of the shop where the cost of the item appears to be the cheapest. Then, go to the Faerie Quest page in Pet Central and, viola, your quest is finished. And now, here's the 9 faeries who will ask you to do a quest for them (Fountain Faerie being the most rare), what kind of item they request, and what reward they give.<table><tr><td>

<h1>» Fountain Faerie Quests</h1>

<td>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1596.gif" style="float: right;">Have you ever gone to the rainbow fountain only to have the fountain faerie say that too many Neopians have bathed in her water and to come back later? And then, you returned 20 times that day, and she said the same thing each time. Well, I guess I should end your pain by telling you that no matter how many times you go there, she's going to say that, <i>unless</i> you finish her quest.<br><br><b>Getting a quest</b><br>Just like all other faerie quests, the fountain faerie's quests are random. But, they are also very, very rare. On average, people get one a year, this can not hold true though. Sometimes newbies get them, and sometimes people have been here 6 years and haven't gotten a fountain faerie quest.<br><br><b>Poof</b><br>So lets say that by a very small chance the fountain faerie suddenly poofs out of no where and asks you to get her an item. Now what? Well, you get to either accept the quest or not. In my opinion you should do it because the reward is great, but more of that later ;)<br><br>Now to get the item, the hard part. The items she asks for are always extremely expensive, and sometimes you can't even buy them yet because they just came out that day! So, long story short, she can ask for whatever she wants and you have to supply it.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/173.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Looking</b><br>To find the item, just like in a regular quest, you can not use the shop wizard. But, if you are 13+, you can use the boards Quest or Help boards. When using the boards, make sure you put some thing about Fountain Faerie Quest or FFQ in the title of your thread. Since those kind of quests are so rare, people will be more likely to help you out with any questions or to help you look up an item. A good example of a thread title would be...<br><br>:P I just got a { F | F | Q } *violin*<br><br>The similes will get people's attention and the creativeness of the title will get people more excited to help you too! (feel free to copy and paste the above as your title, I really don't mind)<br><br><b>Giving the item</b><br>So someone answered your post and you amazingly had enough to by the item. Then you go to the Rainbow Fountain and push the button that says, "I have the _____" Then the fountain faerie will say (assuming you had the item) "The next time you visit my rainbow fountain, I will have a little surprise for you!" Yay! You actually get to bathe in the magical waters of the fountain now!<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/787.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Bathing</b><br>First, before going to the fountain you should decide which of your pets will receive the reward of being *trumpets blaring* PAINTED! Once you decide, head over to the Fountain Faerie and she will say, "Thanks for completing a quest for me - I really appreciate it. As a reward, you can go into the fountain and select a great new color! Almost any color you want!" <br><br>Below this will be a picture of your pet and a drop down menu of the colors you could possibly paint it, and that list is long! It includes every color possible, with the exception of MSP, Royal, and Robot. (To see 
some of the colors of paint you can visit my tutorial on <a href="#pbs" class="you">paint brushes</a> or to see <i>all</i> the possible colors, visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pool/all_pb.phtml" class="you">Rainbow pool</a>)<br><br>Now the simple part, choose a pet and have it painted! A beautiful/scary/ugly/weird color that will make all of Neopia step back and go "Woah".

<h1>» Site Themes</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1866.gif" style="float: left;">Site Themes. It a subject lots of people know absolutely nothing about. If this is the case, then enjoy this little tutorial I made for you. :)<br><br><b>What is it?</b><br>First of all, I'd better tell you what a site theme is. A site theme is a way of viewing Neopets. It's hard to explain if you've never changed your site theme, so I'll use screenies. Right now, if you have never changed your site theme, it is a yellow color and looks like this<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/untitled-1.jpg" width="570" height="150"><br><br><br>Nothing wrong with viewing Neopets like that. But, if you change your site theme to, say, green. It would look like this<br><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/greentutorial-1.jpg" width="570" height="150"><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/193.gif">Do you get what a site theme is? If not, try experimenting to see what it is by changing your site theme.<br><br><b>Changing your site theme</b><br>To change your site theme is quite easy. Simply go to My Account, Set Site Preferences, and go down to <b>Theme</b> (it should be second to last). If you have never changed your site preference, then the drop down menu will be set to Neopets basic. Now you can change it. Push submit and your site preference will change.<br><br><b>Default and Secret</b><br>
Just like avatars, there are default and secret site themes that you can collect. The default themes that everyone has are: Neopets Basic, Neopets Yellow, Neopets Red, Neopets Blue, and Neopets Green. There are also many secret site themes that you have to do something special 
to get. Here are the site themes that you can collect (no retired ones) to make Neopets a more beautiful place to view.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/018_prpl_f65b1/header_bg.png" width="570" border="0"><br><br><b>Neopets Purple</b><br>To get the purple header, visit a purple pet with a purple petpet.

Buy A Mysterious Valentine and send it to a friend who doesn't have the site theme either on February 14th. Then, both you and the person you sent the card to get the site theme. It's best to either wait until Feb 7th when they start selling the card in shops, or buy it off season, like September, when it's not in demand. The price will be lower.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/006_val_d85a0/footer_bg.png" border="0" width="570"><br><br><br><hr><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/005_win_57061/banner_bg.png" border="0" width="570"><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/Pet/christmastutorial.jpg" border="0" width="570"><br><br><b>Winter Holiday</b><br>For the past 3 years this theme has been handed out as a prize in advent calendar. However, the date was random and some people didn't even get it even though they visited the advent calendar. Neopets has informed us that getting the site theme is NOT random and it does have requirements and it is not the time you visit the advent calendar. Until we figure this one out though, you'll just have to chance it when visiting the advent calendar this year.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/005_win_57061/footer_bg.png" border="0" width="570"><br><br><br><hr><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/004_bir_a2e60/header_bg.png" border="0" width="570"><br><br><b>Happy Birthday</b><br>Yay!

This site theme will automatically set itself as your site theme on both of those days and when you have this theme, you have a greater chance for Random Events! Double Yay!<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/004_bir_a2e60/footer_bg.png" border="0" width="570"><br><br><br><hr><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/003_hws_9bde9/banner_bg.png" border="0" width="570"><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/003_hws_9bde9/header_bg.png" border="0" width="570"><br><br><b>Halloween</b><br>To get this site theme, you have to stay up on the spookiest night of the year, Halloween, and refresh Neopets during 11:59PM NST.

<h1>» Paint Brushes</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/645.gif" style="float: left;">You've been saving your neopoints for quite a while now and want to know what to do with them. Well, one fun way to spend your neopoints is to paint your pet using a paint brush. And I'm not talking the standard red, yellow, blue, or green. There are many different colors that you can use on your pet.<br><br><b>Painting Your Pet</b><br>To paint your pet once you have a paint brush is very easy. What you do is go to Neopia Central, Rainbow pool. There will be a picture of your paint brush(es) and all your pets. You can choose from the drop down menus what pet you want painted one color. Remember that a paintbrush only paints one pet.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/536.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Colors</b><br>There are lots of different paint brushes to choose from when deciding to paint your pet. They range from pretty inexpensive to millions of your hard earned neopoints. Here is a little chart showing a picture of one of the main paint brushes, it's name, and what an aisha would look like when painted it. If you want to see what your pet would look like painted, go to Neopia Central and head over to the Rainbow Pool. Click all Neopet colors on the top and play around with the drop down boxes. Remember, not all pets can be painted all colors.<br><br>
*Note: When you paint your pet with a royal paint brush, your pet will be painted differently based on gender. Shown are both the male and female versions of the royal paint brush.<table><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/babypaintbrush.gif"></td>

<h1>» Books</h1>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1344.gif" style="float: left;">Books are something that you can buy, trade for, or are given as a random event. You just read them to your pet and, viola, your pet's intelligence sometimes increases.<br><br>Also, if you pet reads a great number of books, you could be eligible to win a trophy! But the sad thing is, you can't keep reading your pet the same book over and over again. Once you read a book to your pet, it disappears into a puff of smoke. Also, if you buy the same book again to read to your pet, it will say that your pet has already read that book and will not read it again.<br><br>Also, some pets will not read some books because they "find them boring." One way to make your pet read a book is to change the language you view Neopets in and try again.<br><br>So here is a list of the books in Neopia that I have cared to list for you as a starting point for making your pet super duper intelligent.<br><br>I know, there are many, many books, but this is only a starting point. Neopets has many books and trying to find all of them is pretty much impossible unless you're TNT.<br><br><table><tr><td><ul><li>Alphabet</li>

<h1>» Neopian Currencies</h1>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1115.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Ka-Ching!</b><br>
When you think of money in Neopets, you generally think "Neopoints." And, while Neopoints are the most common form of currency, their are 2 other forms that are used in Neopian Shops and training. This guide will explain all forms of money, how to use it, and where to find it.<br><br><b>Neopoints</b><br>
As stated above, neopoints (np) are the most common form of money in Neopets. Np is awarded after sending your score in games and when selling items in your shop. You can also spend np on items in shops, on trades, or in auctions. Neopoints are used in all Neopian shops except those on Krawk Island. Other than that, this money is rather self-explanatory.<br><br><b>Dubloons</b><br>
Dubloons are the main currency on <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/index.phtml" class="you">Krawk Island</a>. In Krawk Island shops, you can spend your dubloons on Nippers (Petpets), The Smuggler's Cove, and The Golden Dubloon (restaurant). You can also spend your dubloons training your pet at <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml" class="you">The Academy</a>.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1113.gif" style="float: right;">More of that later.<br><br>

In order to buy anything in dubloons, you have to have the exact amount of dubloons on you. For instance, if something cost One dubloon, and you only had a two dubloon coin on you, you couldn't buy it. You would need a one dubloon coin. There is no change on Krawk Island, and you can't switch out your coins for lower denomination coins. You can however, switch out your lower demonination coins for higher ones, if you have enough.<br><br>

If you have piles upon piles of dubloons, and hate lugging them around, you can switch them out for a higher coin. Example, 5 Two Dubloon coins for one Ten Dubloon coin. To do this, you have to have the coins you want to switch out in your Inventory and visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/dubloonomatic.phtml" class="you">Dubloon-o-Matic</a>. When you switch out your coins though, make sure that what you are going to buy on Krawk Island is worth that many dubloons, because you can not change back into smaller coins. This machine is handy though if you want to buy an expensive item, but can't fit all those One Dubloon coins in your inventory.<br><br><b>Codestones</b><br>
Codestones aren't the official currency of any part of Neopia. They are really only used as currency when training your pet at <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/index.phtml" class="you">Mystery Island</a> in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/training.phtml" class="you">Training School</a>. But, again, we'll cover training a little bit later.<br><br>

There are 10 regular codestones. They are as follows, along with the approximate price in Neopian user's shops. Most inexpensive are at the top.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1759.gif" style="float: left;"><i>Bri Codestone</i> 3,000np<br><i>Main Codestone</i> 3,000np<br><i>Har Codestone</i> 3,000np<br><i>Mau Codestone</i> 3,500np<br><i>Tai-Kai Codestone</i> 3,800np<br><i>Vo Codestone</i> 4,000np<br><i>Lu Codestone</i> 4,500np<br><i>Orn Codestone</i> 4,500np<br><i>Zei Codestone</i> 4,500np<br><i>Eo Codestone</i> 6,500np<br><br>

Codestones are given often through Random Events, and if you don't sell or use them, you'll find that you have a lot in stock. If you keep collecting them, you may find that you have at least 1 of each type. Now, you can do something special with them.<br><br>

Visit the Mystery Island Volcano (aka <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/volcano_codestone.phtml" class="you">Techo Mountain</a>) and you'll find a Kougra asking you for several codestones. If you have all of them in your inventory and you give them to her, she'll give you a red codestone. Red codestones are rather valuable. They sell from 20k to 45k, but these prices are subject to inflation (or deflation for that matter). There are 6 different kinds of red codestones, and it is random which one you are given when you hand over your regular codestones. Here are the 6 red codestones, along with the average price.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1956.gif" style="float: right;"><i>Mag Codestone</i> 20,000np<br><i>Vux Codestone</i> 25,000np<br><i>Cui Codestone</i> 35,000np<br><i>Kew COdestone</i> 40,000np<br><i>Sho Codestone</i> 45,000np<br><i>Zed Codestone</i> 45,000np<br><br>

Red codestones are used to train pets that are over level 200 (aka Grand Master) at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/training.phtml?type=courses" class="you">Mystery Island Training School</a>. However, if you do not train your pet, or go into the battledome, you would be better off selling your codestones. As you can see, they are worth a rather lot, and you will most likely make a profit.<br><br><b>Training</b><br>
The most common thing you will use codestons and dubloons for, is training your pets. Training your pets at either the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/training.phtml?type=courses" class="you">Mystery Island Training School</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml" class="you">The Academy</a> will raise their level, endurance (hit points), strength, agility (quickness), defense, or whatever you choose to study.<br><br>

Training at the Mystery Island training School is pretty simple. You choose which pet you are training and what you want to study (make sure your level is high enough before studying strength, agility, defense, or endurance). Then, it will take you to a page the shows your pets, and what pets are studying what. It will also show which codestone(s) you need to give the master in order to start training. How long training takes depends on how advanced your pet is in that craft, but you can still play games, talk on the NeoBoards, and shop while your pet is training. You can not, however, enroll your pet in the Swashbuckling Academy while training at Mystery Island Training School. When the training is up, visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/training.phtml?type=status" class="you">status page</a> again and check out your move advanced Neopet.<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1732.gif" style="float: left;">The Swashbuckling Academy is just like the Mystery Island Training School, except you pay in dubloons instead of codestones. In order to pay for your courses, you must have the exact amount of dubloons in your inventory. You can not pay for a 1 dubloon training session with a 5 dubloon coin, for example. Also, when your pet is training in the Academy, you can not enroll that pet in the Training School. You can enroll other pets though.<br><br><b>Finished</b><br>
Codestones, dubloons, and of course Neopoints; the 3 currencies of Neopian. Know them well, and you don't have to worry about going somewhere where the native won't accept your money. Safe traveling ;D<br><br></div>
