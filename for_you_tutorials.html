<h1>» For You's Homepage</h1>

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1242.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Hi-ya</b><br>
This is For You, a site designed to fit your needs. Our tutorials are created to be easy to read and follow, so I hope you find them as such.<br><br><b>Reviews</b><br>
For You has been reviewed by a couple sites. If you wish to know what our score was, click on <a href="#reviews" class="you">Reviews</a> in our navigation and look through them. Each has the score written below, along the percentage and a comment the reviewer made about our site. Best reviews are on top. :)<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1947.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Graphics</b><br>
While there are some graphics on the site that you may use, this is not a site focused on graphics. Here at For You, we focus mainly on high quality tutorials. Therefore, there is no requesting graphics. I add graphics for fun, and to put a little extra into the site :D
<br><br><b>Credit</b><br>
This layout was created and coded by me, Grandtree. Although, I do give thanks to neo-faeriewings for helping me learn how to code my own work by looking at how they coded theirs. Images are from Neopets.com, layout made in Gimp.<br><br><br><center>Counter started on 6-23-2009

Our first background! Yay!<br><br><b>10-17-2009</b>: One more pet page was added.

And, we added another affiliate today!<br><br><b>10-8-2009</b>: I added a <a href="/~Toplamak#oplayout" class="you">Paramore pet page</a> layout.

<h1>» Rachael</h1>
<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1244.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Me!</b><br>
You're probably wondering who's behind this masterful tutorial site. Or maybe you accidentally clicked on this link when trying to see one of the tutorials. Either way, if you're willing to listen, I'm willing to talk or, well, type.<br><br>
My name is Rachael. You probably already got that though. And I decided to make this site after a disastrous attempt at a graphics site. So, I moved away from the highly competitive graphics area into the peaceful tutorial area of Neopets. So now I am much more happy and at peace of mind. However, for fun I still make simple, fun graphics just to add a bit more of a special touch to our site. These are for you to either use or ignore, but I still focus on the tutorials.<br><br><b>Why make it?</b><br>
I made this site because I was sick of having to always click off of Neopets in order to get to a site with a lot of tutorials. On Neopets it was always one tutorial at a time and I really had to hunt for anything I needed to know.<br><br>So, I tried to think of most of the things an average Neopian needs, and would want, to know and put them all on one easy to find site. Aren't you glad I did?<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1798.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Fine Taste</b><br>
A little bit more about me is that I love royal pets, especially Aisha, JubJub, Koi, and Flotsam. They are all so royal looking and I am <i>still</i> saving up for one. I'm someone who like to waste their neopoints. But, if I ever hold back enough to be able to afford to paint one of my pets, I'll be sure to let you know!<br><br><b>*Ahem*</b><br>
That's it. My neomail-box is always open. And, if for some strange reason it is full, send me a junk item to let me know to delete those old ones. I'd also like to quickly add that I am also a part of an off-site Neopets help page, and i go under the name Tonks. So, if any of my tutorials look similar to another sites, check to see who wrote it at the top. If it says Tonks, that means that I did in fact write it, but I am using it on two different pages ;D<br><br>

<h1>» Wall of Shame</h1>

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1684.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Shame!</b><br>
I hope you never end up here, for this is <i>For You's</i> Wall of Shame. First, let's go through how you get here.<br><br>1. Stealing my words. These tutorials are mine, and copying them is against my rules. Please neomail me if you see anyone doing this.<br><br>2. Impersonating me. I highly doubt this will ever happen, but it's nice to put here so you don't.<br><br>3. I can't think of any others. However, use common sense when at my tutorials.<br><br>Now, don't think that I just put people on here automatically. If I see someone doing one of the above, first I neomail them and ask why they decided to break one of my rules. If I receive no answer after 2 weeks, I send them a second neomail asking them why they haven't responded. If, for some reason, they do not respond to this neomail after one month I send hem a final neomail informing them that I have put them on the Wall of Shame.

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1916.gif" style="float: right;">If someone answers my neomails rudely or denies that they copied, then, after 3 neomails, I will inform them that they are on my Wall of Shame.<br><br>
Once you are on the Wall of Shame, it is quite easy to get down. Just an apology through neomail will suffice and you will be off. However, I will keep my eye on you and if I find you breaking the rules again, I will simply neomail you telling you that you are up here again.<br><br>
Once you are on the Wall of Shame 3 times, you are up here permanently. Sorry.<br><br><br><br><b>People on the Wall of Shame</b><br>
Hooray! No one! :D You're all on my good list. *Feels proud*

<h1>» FAQ</h1>

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1797.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Questions?</b><br>
Do you have a question about FYT? If so, try to check here before neomailing me. You may just find the answer. However, if your question is not answered here, please neomail me. I really don't mind getting neomails. Also, I should be able to answer within 1-2 days.<br><br><b>So, what is For You Tutorials?</b><br>For You Tutorials (FYT) is a Neopian site dedicated to tutorials and simple graphics. We are not a collection of other people's tutorials. These are all hand written by me, rachaeltigercat1.<br><br><b>Why did you decide to do this?</b><br>Honestly, it's because I couldn't find any good, consistent tutorial sites on Neopets. Directories would usually have a bunch of broken links, and all large sites would be off Neopets.<br><br><b>How do you get ideas for tutorials?</b><br>Mostly by lurking at the Help Boards. I take the questions many people ask about, and I write tutorials about them. Also, once in a while another Neopian will neomail me with an idea for a tutorial, which I then use.<br><br><b>Can I neomail you with an idea for a tutorial?</b><br>Go right ahead.<br><br><b>Can I request a graphic?</b><br>Sorry, no. I am too busy working on tutorials to be adding graphics all the time. It's more of a hobby then a passion.<br><br><b>How did you code your petpage?</b><br>I will soon be putting up a tutorial showing how I code petpages in general, and the coding I generally used will be on that page. Until then, please try to keep neomails about my coding to a minimum.

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/666.gif" style="float: right;"><b>We're Everywhere!</b><br>To make sure For You Tutorials gets known out there in the Neopian world, I've become a part of a couple directory sites. Directories are petpage that list a bunch of sites to help you look for the tutorials/graphics/other you need.<br><br>
I used to keep these links in the navigation bar, but they started to take up too much space, and the page became very long. So, they are now listed here. Once I am in more, I will organize them.<br><br><center>

Over the time FYT has been opened, I have entered myself into a few review sites, so I could know what to do to improve usage of the site. But, entering review sites is addicting, and pretty soon my entire navigation bar was filled with these cute little buttons. So, I moved them and decided to give them their own separate, little page.<br><br>Reviews are organized first by whether they are finished or pending. If they are finished, they are organized by score. Also, I added a general comment that was made about our site from the reviewer, so you know what they said. Of course, if you wish to read the entire review, simply click on their button and find our review.<br><br><h1>Finished</h1>

If you just loved our site and want to remember how to get here, just take a button and put it on your userlookup, pet page, guild, or shop. I would greatly appreciate it, but it is not at all necessary. (:<br><br>If you are or wish to be one of For You's affiliates, please take a button and put it on at least the homepage of your site, if not every page of your site. Your button is on every page of mine. Remember, when you take my button down, I take yours down. But I doubt that will happen.<br><br>Anyways, I tried to make the buttons as stylish and little as possible so you can put them places without having them loud and obnoxious. So, enjoy!<br><br><center>

<h1>» Packrat</h1>

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/291.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Getting started</b><br>
If you're reading this, then you probably are seeking the amazing packrat avatar.<br><br><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/sdb.gif" border="0"></center>
<br>
The packrat avatar is an avatar that will probably take you at least a week to get, but getting there is half the fun!<br><br><br><b>How to get it</b><br>
To get the packrat avatar, you have to look at your Safety Deposit Box (SDB) when it has 1,000 different items in it. Not 1,000 items all together, but 1,000 different items. You can see how many items your safety deposit box has by going to it and looking at the top. You should see something that says Items: xxx | Qty: xxx where the xxx is the number. Items is how many different items you have, while Qty is how many items you have all together.<br><br>
That's a lot of items, and it can be kind of hard finding so many items to put in your SDB for cheap. So, For You has made a list of 1,000 items for 150nps or less to start filling up your SDB. Scroll down a bit more and you'll find it.<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1980.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Shop Boards</b><br>
There's another way to get Neopian items for cheap though. It's name is <i>1np sales</i>. If you are over 13, you can visit the NeoBoards. If you visit the <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=11" class="you">Shop Ads Board</a>, you'll see a bunch of threads posting things like "Visit my cheap shop!" and "I need a ____ for cheap!" But, there are also occasionally boards saying things like 1np Sale! Those are what you are here for.<br><br>
1np Sales are when a user is feeling generous so they will, after a certain number of people post on their board, post a time where, in their shop, there will be a number of items for 1np that usually sell for more. It's usually items that are worth 30-50 neopoints they are putting up, But sometimes there will be rare, even pricey items they are giving away.<br><br>
What's so great about these sales is that you are getting practically free items you can resell or use and you can get items for your SDB collection for very cheap. However, many people use these sales, so in order to get the items the generous user is practically giving away, you need to be quick.<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1167.gif" style="float: left;">
Before the user even posts the time for the next sale, have their shop open on another tab so you don't go searching for the link. Next, when they do post the time, go over to their shop 1 minute early and begin refreshing. Sometimes the user will start the sale a little early, giving you a chance to get some items before other people have gotten to the shop. And lastly, have fun. Chat with the other people on that board and get to know the person hosting the sale. Make friends and time will go by quicker between sales.<br><br><b>Da List</b><br>
Now for the list. The list of 1,000 items that you can buy for cheap to over stuff your SDB. but remember, this list is a jumping off point. If there are other items you want to use for Packrat, go ahead and use them.<br><br>
I'd also like to mention that while some words have underscores at the end of them, like onion_ you do not include the underscore when searching it on the shop wizard, trades, auctions, or however it is that you are getting these items. That underscore is put in automatically by TNT, just so you know :)<br><br>And, with this enormous list, I leave you. Good luck in your search for the SDB - Packrat avatar!<br><br><font color="#1F5C2C" size="4">#</font><br>

<h1>» Saving Gimp Brushes</h1>

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1198.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Ooh!</b><br>
So, you found For You's guide to saving gimp brushes. No, that doesn't mean you'll be saving gimp brushes from harm like Superman or Wonderwoman, because I know that's what you thought this tutorial was about ;) But it means to save images in Gimp, so you can use them as brushes later on.<br><br><b>Why do I need brushes?</b><br>
Brushes simply add pizazz to otherwise plain pictures. They make layouts and graphics look more interesting, and professional. Here's a little glimpse of what a couple of simple brushes can do to a picture.<br><br><br><center>
<img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/brush-tutorial.png"><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/brush-tutorial-2-1.png">
</center>

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/765.gif" style="float: left;"><br><br><b>Which one?</b><br>
Wasn't the second image more beautiful? I personally thought it was, and if you want your images to look like that, brushes are a must. On the second image, I used three distinct brushes. That's all. So, now that you know that images can enhance your images, on to the tutorial.<br><br><b>Finding your brushes</b><br>
You do not need to download brushes from other sites to make brushes. All you need is your program of Gimp, and an image, preferably black-and-white. There are certain websites you can go to, though for images that are great for brushes. These sites have pages of images, made just so you can use them on your graphics. Here are some marvelous, Neopets sites that have great brushes.<br><br><a href="/~Dravion" class="you">Arie's Stamps</a><br><a href="/~mizzkacheekxx" class="you">Chelsea's Stamps</a><br><a href="/~rowlingx" class="you">Jay and Erin's Resource Page</a><br><a href="/~Palmpa" class="you">Luna's Stamps</a><br><a href="/~xthedoll" class="you">Mary's Stamps</a><br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/429.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Stamps?</b><br>
If you noticed that the above links say that they are actually giving you stamps, and got a little confused, you're not alone. Stamps and brushes are very, very similar. <i>Brushes</i> are used like pens or pencils. You can drag them across the page, and they'll make one continuous line. <i>Stamps</i> are used like stamps. You do not drag stamps across your page, you just press down and release.<br><br>But here's where it gets even trickier. Brushes can be used as stamps. IE, you can turn a stamp into a brush, and it will work just fine. So, imagine clicking on your brush tool, and selecting a normal circle as your brush. You could either drag that brush across the page, or you could just click once, and leave a perfect circle behind. So, what I'm saying is, that even though those sites say they are stamps, and they are, you can save them as brushes, without any worries ;D<br><br><b>Copying your brush</b><br>
For this tutorial, I am going to be using one of the brushes from Arie's Stamps (link above) just so you can see how to do it with the pages above. You go to the site, and then scroll down until you find a stamp you like. Then right click on it, and choose Copy Image.<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/finding-brush.png"></center>
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/710.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Pasting and selecting your brush</b><br>Now that you have copied your brush, open your Gimp program, and go to Edit - Paste. If you used one of the sites above, you'll see that the stamp you wanted wasn't the only thing you just pasted. Lots of other stamps cam along for the ride. So, choose your lasso tool, and outline the stamp that you want to use. When you're finished choose Edit - Copy, then Edit - Paste as - New image.<br><br><center>
<img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/copying-brush-1.png"><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/copying-brush2-1.png"><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/copying-brush3.png"><br><br>
</center>

<img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1276.gif" style="float: right;">Now, the stamp you selected should be in another window of Gimp. Go along the edges of the image and erase all the little stray pixels that aren't a part of your stamp, if you have any. Then, go up to Layer - Transparency - Color to Alpha. A little screen will the pop up, showing your image. Make sure that the color you have selected is white, and view your image. There should be no white spaces, and it should look very crisp and clear. If it does, push okay.<br><br><center>
<img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/transparency.png"><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/transparency2.png">
</center>
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1832.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Almost done!</b><br>
Now, your actual image should look just like it did in the preview. Go up to Image - Mode - Grayscale. This makes your image into black-and-white, which it should be already. But, you can't save it as an image if it's not in that mode.<br><br>Now, you may choose select - all and then Edit - copy. I trust that you don't need a screenie for that :)<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/Mode-brush.png"></center>
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/825.gif" style="float: right;"><b>Saving your brush</b><br>Now that you've copied your brush, go to Edit - Paste As - New Brush... Another screen will pop up. Rewrite the Brush Name whatever you wish. I will be naming mine Line-Dots because it looks like a line of dots to me, and when I am looking for that brush, it will be easier to find. Leave the file name alone. It should say mybrush, do NOT change that, and leave the spacing at 25px. Trust me, that's where you want it to be. ^^. Then choose OK to save your brush!<br><br><center><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/New-brush.png"></center>
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1376.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Yes, done!</b><br>Congratulations, you've created a brush! That wasn't so hard, was it? Now, if you want to learn how to find your brush, stay tuned.<br><br>To find your brush, click on the Paintbrush Tool, to start. You will find, later on, that your brush can be used on many other tools, but the Paint Brush tool is the most basic, and easy to understand. When you click on it, below, some new text should appear. Next to the word Brush, there should be a box. Click on it, and find your brush.<br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc114/rtigercat/FYT/Where-brush.png" style="float: right;"><b>What else?</b><br>After choosing your brush, you can also then choose the opacity and scale. the opacity is how see-through your brush is. If the opacity is at 100%, then you can not see any of the background behind it. If it is at 0%, then the image is clear. Try out this setting for further explanation. the scale is how big the brush is. If the scale is at exactly 1, then your brush will be the same size as when you copy and pasted it when you created it. If the number is less than 1, then it is smaller, more than one and it is larger. Also try out this setting.<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1729.gif" style="float: left;"><b>Experiment Time!</b><br> Now, the choice is up to you. You can create more brushes if you like, or you could try them out, or you could close down Gimp and forget you ever made a brush. But, I have to admit, playing with the brushes is fun. If you know how to layer images, you can have a blast with brushes. Changing their color also changes the feeling of the picture. Have white, snowflake-like brushes in the corner of your image, and you automatically think "winter" or "snow".<br><br>Once you get the hang of brushes, you'll wonder what you ever did without them. Until then, look at other people's graphics to see how they used their brushes. (You will also notice that the difference between good graphics and amazing graphics is the brush work) and study it. Never steal another person's image, but look at how they layered and color schemed their brushes.<br><br>Okay, I am leaving you now ;-; But, if you liked this tutorial, or have some comments or advice for me, neomail me <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send" class="you">here</a> and let me know.
